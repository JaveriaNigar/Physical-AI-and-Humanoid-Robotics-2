## What is ROS 2?

**ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) is the industry-standard middleware for robot control and communication. Think of it as the **nervous system** of a robot:

- **Brain** ↔ **Spinal Cord (ROS 2)** ↔ **Muscles & Sensors**

Just like your nervous system carries signals from your brain to your muscles and back, ROS 2 carries commands from your control algorithms to motors, and sensor data back to perception systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Understand ROS 2 architecture**: Nodes, Topics, and Services
2. **Write Python ROS 2 nodes** using rclpy to control robots
3. **Bridge AI agents** (like LLMs) to ROS controllers
4. **Describe robot structure** using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
5. **Implement pub-sub communication** for sensor data and commands

## Module Structure

### **Lesson 1: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services**
- What are nodes, topics, and services?
- Publish-Subscribe pattern
- Request-Response (Service) pattern
- Real-world examples from humanoid robotics

### **Lesson 2: Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers**
- Writing custom ROS 2 nodes in Python (rclpy)
- Connecting an LLM agent to a ROS 2 controller
- Example: Voice command → ROS 2 action → Robot movement

### **Lesson 3: URDF for Humanoids**
- What is URDF?
- Defining links (rigid bodies) and joints
- Example: 6-DOF arm URDF
- Tesla Optimus humanoid structure overview

## Real-World Context

When you deploy a humanoid robot like Tesla Optimus or Boston Dynamics' Atlas, **everything runs through ROS 2**:

-  **AI/LLM agent** (e.g., Llama 3 running on GPU) → ROS 2 node
-  **Sensor drivers** (cameras, IMUs, force sensors) → ROS 2 publishers
-  **Motor controllers** → ROS 2 subscribers
-  **Path planner** → ROS 2 service

This module teaches you the **glue** that holds it all together.

## Prerequisites

- Comfort with Python programming
- Basic understanding of networking concepts (client-server, publish-subscribe)
- Linux command line familiarity (ROS 2 runs on Ubuntu)

## Time Estimate

- **Lessons 1-2**: ~4 hours
- **Lesson 3**: ~3 hours
- **Hands-on projects**: ~6 hours
- **Total**: ~13 hours
