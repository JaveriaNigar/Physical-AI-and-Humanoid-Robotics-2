## What is NVIDIA Isaac?

**NVIDIA Isaac** is a **robotics platform** providing:

1. **Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation engine (built on Omniverse)
2. **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated perception (VSLAM, object detection)
3. **Isaac Nav2**: Autonomous navigation for bipedal robots

Think of it as **the brain** that perceives the world, plans paths, and makes decisions.

## Why NVIDIA Isaac?

-  **RTX rendering**: Photorealistic graphics → better training data
-  **GPU acceleration**: VSLAM runs on NVIDIA GPU (10× faster)
-  **ROS 2 native**: Seamless integration with ROS 2 middleware
-  **Sim-to-real**: Trained models deploy directly to real robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Simulate humanoids photorealistically** in Isaac Sim
2. **Train perception models** with synthetic data
3. **Implement GPU-accelerated VSLAM** for localization
4. **Plan collision-free paths** for bipedal locomotion
5. **Deploy trained models to real robots**

## Real-World Impact

Tesla Optimus and Boston Dynamics' robots use this pipeline:

1. **Training Phase** (Isaac Sim):
   - Generate 1M+ synthetic images
   - Train vision models (object detection, segmentation)
   - Test navigation algorithms

2. **Deployment Phase** (Isaac ROS + Nav2):
   - Run VSLAM on onboard GPU
   - Detect obstacles in real-time
   - Plan safe paths around humans/objects

Result: Fully autonomous humanoids that navigate complex human environments.
