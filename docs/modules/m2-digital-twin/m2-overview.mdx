## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot that runs in real-time simulation. It's essential for:

-  **Rapid iteration**: Test algorithms without hardware risk
-  **Training**: Generate synthetic data for machine learning
-  **Visualization**: See what the robot perceives and plans
-  **Research**: Simulate edge cases and failure modes

Modern humanoid development uses **two layers**:
1. **Gazebo**: Physics-accurate simulation engine (ODE, Bullet, DART)
2. **Unity**: Photorealistic rendering and HRI visualization

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Simulate physics** in Gazebo
   - Rigid body dynamics
   - Contact and friction
   - Gravity effects

2. **Model sensors** in simulation
   - RGB cameras
   - Depth sensors (stereo, LiDAR)
   - IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)
   - Force/torque sensors

3. **Render photorealistic scenes** in Unity
   - Real-time rendering
   - Physics-based materials
   - Dynamic lighting

4. **Bridge Gazebo ↔ Unity** via ROS 2
   - Synchronize robot state
   - Stream camera data
   - Visualize planned trajectories

5. **Apply domain randomization** for sim-to-real transfer
   - Randomize friction, mass, lighting
   - Improve real-world robustness

## Module Structure

### **Lesson 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation**
- Setting up Gazebo Ignition
- Configuring physics engines
- Loading URDF and SDF models
- Monitoring simulation state

### **Lesson 2: Unity Rendering & Visualization**
- Importing robots to Unity
- Real-time rendering
- Virtual camera feeds
- Human-robot interaction (HRI)

### **Lesson 3: Sensor Simulation**
- Camera simulation (RGB, depth)
- IMU sensor dynamics
- Force/torque sensors
- Realistic sensor noise

## Real-World Impact

When Tesla Optimus or Boston Dynamics' Atlas is trained, engineers use:

1. **Physics Simulation** (Gazebo)
   - Train locomotion controllers
   - Test manipulation strategies
   - Validate safety constraints

2. **High-Fidelity Rendering** (Unity)
   - Stream to dashboards for teleoperation
   - Generate training data for vision models
   - Demonstrate tasks to stakeholders

3. **Sensor Simulation**
   - Test computer vision algorithms
   - Validate IMU-based balance control
   - Train visual servoing controllers

The result: A policy trained entirely in simulation can be **deployed to real hardware** with 70-90% performance retention.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of physics concepts (mass, inertia, friction)
- ROS 2 basics from Module 1
- Basic C# for Unity modifications (optional)

## Time Estimate

- **Lesson 1 (Gazebo)**: ~5 hours
- **Lesson 2 (Unity)**: ~4 hours
- **Lesson 3 (Sensors)**: ~4 hours
- **Hands-on projects**: ~8 hours
- **Total**: ~21 hours
